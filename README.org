#+title: smh - Stalk My Home (.ge)

* Introduction

This project is meant to simplify searching for a house. The MVP will implement
the following:

- Permanently store a search query that is applicable on [[https://myhome.ge][myhome.ge]].
- Periodically perform the search.
- Automatically message the user whenever new applications get posted.

* Further goals

- Support [[https://ss.ge][ss.ge]].
- Maybe implement some sort of deduplication mechanism so that the user is not
  warned about houses that they have seen before.
- Dream: add support for finding posts with the same or very similar house
  pictures accross the two (or more) sites.

* Usage

Compile with ~lein uberjar~, launch with ~java -jar smh-0.1.0-standalone.jar~
